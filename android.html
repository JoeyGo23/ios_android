YOU ARE ANDROID =
You love technology, but you don't feel the need to follow the crowd when it comes to tech trends.
You instead prefer to weigh all your options, figure out what's best for you, and get your own unique gadget.

It's likely that you have a bit of a head for science, engineering, or programming. You have very specific technological needs.
You want to customize whatever gadgets you own, and you don't like limitations. You definitely don't want a cookie cutter phone.

You are probably the type of person who enjoys sci-fi / fantasy, a good pizza, documentaries, and even a little Shakespeare every now and then.
You're quite pop culturally savvy and have a broad range of interests. No one would accuse you of being a snob.
